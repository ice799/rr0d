1. Compiling

NOTE:
rr0d as 3 graphic modes:
* A console mode (for unix, bsd & co)
* A frame buffer mode (using the X framebuffer if you activated it in your kernel)
* An automatic graphic video mode (pci & agp card)

I advice you to select the 3rd mode. here is the configuation to active in the config.h:
/* we want a graphic mode */
#define VIDEO_FB
/* we want direct hardware writtng */
#define HW_FB
/* we want rr0d to find automatically the address of the video hardware */
#define AUTO_HW_FB
/* we set a default value... */
#define SCREEN_ADRESSE 0xF0000000

but erf, it doesn't seem to detect vmware driver...

1.1 Linux

The (current) kernel sources (or at least headers) must be accessible
by '/usr/src/linux'.

You must create and edit the file 'config.h' using the example
'config.h.sample'.

This file must begin with :

#ifndef CONFIG_H
#define CONFIG_H

#define LINUX


Then if you want to use your native frame buffer, you must choose
between '#define VIDEO_FB' (in this case, you *must* have an active
kernel frame buffer) or '#define VIDEO_AA' (the console mode).

If you want 'VIDEO_FB', you must set SCREEN_ADRESSE to the frame
buffer address. To get that value, you can use either the
'/var/log/kern.log' file or the 'dmesg' command. For example :

$ dmesg | grep -E "Framebuffer at 0x[0-9a-d]+, mapped to 0x[0-9a-d]+"
Sep 1 21:03:01 godel kernel: sisfb: Framebuffer at 0xd0000000, mapped
to 0xd001d000, size 8192k

In this case, you will have :

#define SCREEN_ADRESSE 0xD001D000

The next statments are easy to understand :

#define SCREEN_MAX_X 1024
#define SCREEN_MAX_Y 768
#define BYTE_PER_PIXEL 2
#define SCREEN_X_OFFSET 0
#define SCREEN_Y_OFFSET 0



The keyboard interrupt :

#define KEYB_INTER 0x21

And your compiler ASM style (with gcc, ATT) :
#define ATT_ASM

#endif /* CONFIG_H */

You now have to choose the Makefile. If you are running Linux 2.4, run
'cp Makefile-linux Makefile', and with Linux 2.6, 'cp Makefile-26
Makefile'.

Then just run 'make'. If this does not work, try to cut the throat of
a chicken and to spread the warm blood on your keyboard and your
screen (and on your mouse if you have one). Then try again.

1.2 Under Windows

Decomment the:
#define WIN32 
#define KEYB_INTER 0x51 

So, use the automatic video driver:
/* we want a graphic mode */
#define VIDEO_FB
/* we want direct hardware writtng */
#define HW_FB
/* we want rr0d to find automatically the address of the video hardware */
#define AUTO_HW_FB
/* we set a default value... */
#define SCREEN_ADRESSE 0xF0000000


Thus, rr0d will scan your pci bus and try to find by itself your
graphic card

2. Launching

2.1 Linux

As root, run 'insmod ./rr0d.o'. You have just loaded the module
without any problem. Now be rasta and keep any hatred feeling far from
your heart.

2.2 Windows

Compile the driver_loader.c and launch it. A console will popup,
launch rr0d and wait for you.

3. Arrêt

3.1 Sous Linux

As root, just run 'rmmod rr0d'. But keep rasta.

3.2 Sous Windows

Now, press enter in the console, it will stop rr0d

4. Using

For now, to be able to use rr0d, the program has to call int 3
itself. Just add in your code :

__asm("int $0x3;");

Now, you can use the following commands :

 - BL: list the breakpoints ;
 - BPX <ADDRESS>: add a breakpoint at <ADDRESS> ;
 - BC <NUM>: delete breakpoint <NUM> ;
 - F8: run one ASM instruction (equivalent to gdb 'step')
 - F10: just like F8, but does not follow the 'call' instructions
   (equivalent to gdb 'next') ;
 - F12: run until next breakpoint (equivalent to gdb 'cont').

Advanced commands (use with extreme caution) :
 - HELP: display a very usefull help ;
 - DROIDS: display a very important information ;
 - RASTA: run into RASTA mode ; this was the mode used by Bob Marley when
   he cracked WinZip 0.71;
 - UNRASTA: do never use this command unless you *really* know what you are
   doing.
